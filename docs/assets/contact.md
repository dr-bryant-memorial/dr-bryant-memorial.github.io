Regents Professor Dr. Vaughn Motley Bryant Jr. passed away Saturday, January 30th, at his home in College Station, Texas, at the age of 80, in the company of those he loved.

It goes without saying that Dr. Bryant was beloved by many and will be very sorely missed by his family, peers, students, and friends. His large personality has left a void which will be felt for years to come.

A scholarship and botanical memorial will be established in Dr. Bryant's name.  Please check his memorial website or contact the family by email for more information.
